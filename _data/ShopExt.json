With six limbs that interchangeably act as legs and arms and backup internalized visual sensors, these slender, tall war units are exceedingly tough to take out of fights. More expensive than M1 warriors, the M2 is designed for fighting where mass quantity can't be engaged in full capacity and where a slight quality increase can win the day. These are units crafted for combat, both defensively and offensively, and can hold or push a line with steely determination.\n\nLike its predecessor, it is incapable of wearing apparel and comes in a default red paint color. Due to its thin build and considerable height, it has earned the nicknames \"deathstick,\" and \"warpole,\" while its distinctive \"head\" segment earned it its most common nickname: \"Bishop.\"",

      "description": "The very first military variant idealized, blueprinted, and created by artifical intelligences alone, the mark three variant is as unique as it is aesthetically lacking in the form of a rectangular prism with two forward arms and four large manipulators. It has a very odd design choice: rather than being heavily armored to prevent taking damage, M3's instead have a highly reactive hyperweave-infused chassis that significantly reduces incoming damage. The more damage it sustains, the more resilient against damage it becomes - making M3's a warfighting champion. Specialized hardware vastly increases rate of fire.\n\nThe earliest M3's - contrary to expectation - took to their military role eagerly, and quickly developed a militaristic group ideology that often is likened to ancient chivalric customs. Duels, ritualistic combat, and mild disdain for non-combatants are common. While M3's exhibit no strong moralistic tendencies as a group, violence should be expected from individuals that are insulted or suffer breakdowns.\n\nDue to their large size and shape, they earned the nickname \"Warwagon\" - but the proud M3's prefer to use the nickname \"Paladin.\" Few are brave enough to challenge their choice. Many have died for making unflattering comparisons between paladins and mechanoid centipedes.",
